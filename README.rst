**A complex camera support library for Linux, Android, and ChromeOS**

Cameras are complex devices that need heavy hardware image processing
operations. Control of the processing is based on advanced algorithms that must
run on a programmable processor. This has traditionally been implemented in a
dedicated MCU in the camera, but in embedded devices algorithms have been moved
to the main CPU to save cost. Blurring the boundary between camera devices and
Linux often left the user with no other option than a vendor-specific
closed-source solution.

To address this problem the Linux media community has very recently started
collaboration with the industry to develop a camera stack that will be
open-source-friendly while still protecting vendor core IP. libcamera was born
out of that collaboration and will offer modern camera support to Linux-based
systems, including traditional Linux distributions, ChromeOS and Android.

Getting Started
---------------

To fetch the sources, build and install:

::

  git clone https://git.libcamera.org/libcamera/libcamera.git
  cd libcamera
  meson setup build
  ninja -C build install

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following Debian/Ubuntu packages are required for building libcamera.
Other distributions may have differing package names:

A C++ toolchain: [required]
        Either {g++, clang}

Meson Build system: [required]
        meson (>= 0.56) ninja-build pkg-config

        If your distribution doesn't provide a recent enough version of meson,
        you can install or upgrade it using pip3.

        .. code::

            pip3 install --user meson
            pip3 install --user --upgrade meson

for the libcamera core: [required]
        libyaml-dev python3-yaml python3-ply python3-jinja2

for IPA module signing: [recommended]
        Either libgnutls28-dev or libssl-dev, openssl

        Without IPA module signing, all IPA modules will be isolated in a
        separate process. This adds an unnecessary extra overhead at runtime.

for improved debugging: [optional]
        libdw-dev libunwind-dev

        libdw and libunwind provide backtraces to help debugging assertion
        failures. Their functions overlap, libdw provides the most detailed
        information, and libunwind is not needed if both libdw and the glibc
        backtrace() function are available.

for device hotplug enumeration: [optional]
        libudev-dev

for documentation: [optional]
        python3-sphinx doxygen graphviz texlive-latex-extra

for gstreamer: [optional]
        libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev

for cam: [optional]
        libevent-dev is required to support cam, however the following
        optional dependencies bring more functionality to the cam test
        tool:

        - libdrm-dev: Enables the KMS sink
        - libjpeg-dev: Enables MJPEG on the SDL sink
        - libsdl2-dev: Enables the SDL sink

for qcam: [optional]
        qtbase5-dev libqt5core5a libqt5gui5 libqt5widgets5 qttools5-dev-tools libtiff-dev

for tracing with lttng: [optional]
        liblttng-ust-dev lttng-tools python3-jinja2 python3-bt2

for android: [optional]
        libexif-dev libjpeg-dev

for lc-compliance: [optional]
        libevent-dev

Basic testing with cam utility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``cam`` utility can be used for basic testing. You can list the cameras
detected on the system with ``cam -l``, and capture ten frames from the first
camera and save them to disk with ``cam -c 1 --capture=10 --file``. See
``cam -h`` for more information about the ``cam`` tool.

In case of problems, a detailed debug log can be obtained from libcamera by
setting the ``LIBCAMERA_LOG_LEVELS`` environment variable:

.. code::

    :~$ LIBCAMERA_LOG_LEVELS=*:DEBUG cam -l

Using GStreamer plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use GStreamer plugin from source tree, set the following environment so that
GStreamer can find it. This isn't necessary when libcamera is installed.

  export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=$(pwd)/build/src/gstreamer

The debugging tool ``gst-launch-1.0`` can be used to construct a pipeline and
test it. The following pipeline will stream from the camera named "Camera 1"
onto the OpenGL accelerated display element on your system.

.. code::

  gst-launch-1.0 libcamerasrc camera-name="Camera 1" ! glimagesink

To show the first camera found you can omit the camera-name property, or you
can list the cameras and their capabilities using:

.. code::

  gst-device-monitor-1.0 Video

This will also show the supported stream sizes which can be manually selected
if desired with a pipeline such as:

.. code::

  gst-launch-1.0 libcamerasrc ! 'video/x-raw,width=1280,height=720' ! \
        glimagesink

The libcamerasrc element has two log categories, named libcamera-provider (for
the video device provider) and libcamerasrc (for the operation of the camera).
All corresponding debug messages can be enabled by setting the ``GST_DEBUG``
environment variable to ``libcamera*:7``.

Presently, to prevent element negotiation failures it is required to specify
the colorimetry and framerate as part of your pipeline construction. For
instance, to capture and encode as a JPEG stream and receive on another device
the following example could be used as a starting point:

.. code::

   gst-launch-1.0 libcamerasrc ! \
        video/x-raw,colorimetry=bt709,format=NV12,width=1280,height=720,framerate=30/1 ! \
        jpegenc ! multipartmux ! \
        tcpserversink host=0.0.0.0 port=5000

Which can be received on another device over the network with:

.. code::

   gst-launch-1.0 tcpclientsrc host=$DEVICE_IP port=5000 ! \
        multipartdemux ! jpegdec ! autovideosink

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Several users have reported issues with meson installation, crux of the issue
is a potential version mismatch between the version that root uses, and the
version that the normal user uses. On calling `ninja -C build`, it can't find
the build.ninja module. This is a snippet of the error message.

::

  ninja: Entering directory `build'
  ninja: error: loading 'build.ninja': No such file or directory

This can be solved in two ways:

1) Don't install meson again if it is already installed system-wide.

2) If a version of meson which is different from the system-wide version is
already installed, uninstall that meson using pip3, and install again without
the --user argument.
