 *
 * The FrameBuffer class is the primary interface for applications, IPAs and
 * pipeline handlers to interact with frame memory. It contains all the static
 * and dynamic information to manage the whole life cycle of a frame capture,
 * from buffer creation to consumption.
 *
 * The static information describes the memory planes that make a frame. The
 * planes are specified when creating the FrameBuffer and are expressed as a set
 * of dmabuf file descriptors, offset and length.
 *
 * The dynamic information is grouped in a FrameMetadata instance. It is updated
 * during the processing of a queued capture request, and is valid from the
 * completion of the buffer as signaled by Camera::bufferComplete() until the
 * FrameBuffer is either reused in a new request or deleted.
 *
 * The creator of a FrameBuffer (application, IPA or pipeline handler) may
 * associate to it an integer cookie for any private purpose. The cookie may be
 * set when creating the FrameBuffer, and updated at any time with setCookie().
 * The cookie is transparent to the libcamera core and shall only be set by the
 * creator of the FrameBuffer. This mechanism supplements the Request cookie.
 */

/**
 * \struct FrameBuffer::Plane
 * \brief A memory region to store a single plane of a frame
 *
 * Planar pixel formats use multiple memory regions to store the different
 * colour components of a frame. The Plane structure describes such a memory
 * region by a dmabuf file descriptor, an offset within the dmabuf and a length.
 * A FrameBuffer then contains one or multiple planes, depending on the pixel
 * format of the frames it is meant to store.
 *
 * The offset identifies the location of the plane data from the start of the
 * memory referenced by the dmabuf file descriptor. Multiple planes may be
 * stored in the same dmabuf, in which case they will reference the same dmabuf
 * and different offsets. No two planes may overlap, as specified by their
 * offset and length.
 *
 * To support DMA access, planes are associated with dmabuf objects represented
 * by SharedFD handles. The Plane class doesn't handle mapping of the memory to
 * the CPU, but applications and IPAs may use the dmabuf file descriptors to map
 * the plane memory with mmap() and access its contents.
 *
 * \todo Specify how an application shall decide whether to use a single or
 * multiple dmabufs, based on the camera requirements.
