/**
 * \class SharedFD
 * \brief RAII-style wrapper for file descriptors
 *
 * The SharedFD class provides RAII-style lifetime management of file
 * descriptors with an efficient mechanism for ownership sharing. At its core,
 * an internal Descriptor object wraps a file descriptor (expressed as a signed
 * integer) with an RAII-style interface. The Descriptor is then implicitly
 * shared with all SharedFD instances constructed as copies.
 *
 * When constructed from a numerical file descriptor, the SharedFD instance
 * either duplicates or takes over the file descriptor:
 *
 * - The SharedFD(const int &) constructor duplicates the numerical file
 *   descriptor and wraps the duplicate in a Descriptor. The caller is
 *   responsible for closing the original file descriptor, and the value
 *   returned by fd() will be different from the value passed to the
 *   constructor.
 *
 * - The SharedFD(int &&) constructor takes over the numerical file descriptor
 *   and wraps it in a Descriptor. The caller shall not touch the original file
 *   descriptor once the function returns, and the value returned by fd() will
 *   be identical to the value passed to the constructor.
 *
 * The copy constructor and assignment operator create copies that share the
 * Descriptor, while the move versions of those functions additionally make the
 * other SharedFD invalid. When the last SharedFD that references a Descriptor
 * is destroyed, the file descriptor is closed.
 *
 * The numerical file descriptor is available through the fd() function. All
 * SharedFD instances created as copies of a SharedFD will report the same fd()
 * value. Callers can perform operations on the fd(), but shall never close it
 * manually.
 */

 * reference it are destroyed.
 *
 * If the \a fd is negative, the SharedFD is constructed as invalid and the fd()
 * function will return -1.
