/**
 * \struct libcamera::ipa::FixedPointQTraits
 * \brief Traits type implementing fixed-point quantization conversions
 *
 * The FixedPointQTraits structure defines a policy for mapping floating-point
 * values to and from fixed-point 2's complement integer representations. It is
 * parameterised by the number of integer bits \a I, fractional bits \a F, and
 * the integral storage type \a T. The traits are used with Quantized<Traits> to
 * create a quantized type that stores both the fixed-point representation and
 * the corresponding floating-point value.
 *
 * The signedness of the type is determined by the signedness of \a T. For
 * signed types, the number of integer bits in \a I includes the sign bit.
 *
 * Storage is determined by the total number of bits \a (I + F) and is
 * automatically selected, but the internal storage type is always an unsigned
 * integer to guarantee against sign extension when storing quantized values
 * in registers.
 *
 * The trait exposes compile-time constants describing the bit layout, limits,
 * and scaling factors used in the fixed-point representation.
 *
 * \tparam I Number of integer bits
 * \tparam F Number of fractional bits
 * \tparam T Integral type used to store the quantized value
