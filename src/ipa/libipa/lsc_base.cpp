 * \param[in] cropRectangle The sensor analogue crop rectangle
 * \param[in] xPos List of horizontal positions of the LSC grid nodes
 * \param[in] yPos List of vertical positions of the LSC grid nodes
 *
 * LSC tables have to be re-sampled every time a new sensor configuration is
 * used, as each streaming session might use a different sensor crop rectangle
 * \a cropRectangle.
 *
 * \a cropRectangle represents the size of the frame on which the LSC tables
 * have to be re-sampled on.
 *
 * \a xPos and \a yPos represent the position of the grid nodes vertexes in
 * the [0, 1] interval. For example an equally spaced grid of 16 nodes will have
 * each segment of size 0.0625 and the list of nodes position will be
 * [0, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.1875, ... , 1]. It is expected that the first position
 * is 0 and the last position is 1.
 *
 * LSC tables are expressed in two formats:
 * - A list of gain values (LscTable)
 * - A radial polynomial (LscPolynomial)
 *
 * Table-based LSC tables are generated using an image at a fixed resolution and
 * can't at the moment be re-sampled when a different resolution is used for a
 * streaming session. Re-sampling a grid LSC table will return the same table
 * as loaded from the tuning file.
 *
 * \todo: Implement grid based re-sampling
 *
 * Polynomial configurations are more flexible and can be re-sampled for a given
 * sensor frame resolution using a list of horizontal and vertical nodes that
 * define the LSC grid on which the polynomial is re-sampled on.
